Notes:

1.Spectre V1 can be exploited over network connections rather than through local code execution of remotely delivered code such as JavaScript. This remote attack is known as NetSpectre.

2.Spectre V1 has been demonstrated to bypass protections provided by Intel SGX. Intel has updated the SGX SDK to mitigate these vulnerabilities when SGX enclaves are rebuilt.

3.Spectre V1 has been demonstrated to bypass protections provided by the System Management Range Register (SMRR) to access protected System Management Mode (SMM) memory.

4.Linux: eBPF Spectre v1 mitigation is insufficient,causing CVE-2019-7308.(https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1711)

5.The researchers developed a tool to explore how else cyber criminals could take advantage of the CPU flaws and found new techniques that could be used to extract sensitive info like passwords from devices.These techniques, which they've dubbed MeltdownPrime and SpectrePrime, pit two CPU cores against each other to dupe multi-core systems and get access to their cached data.

6.Side-channel attacks such as the Spectre family of vulnerabilities are more widespread threat than previously thought - affecting all microprocessors that employ the performance-enhancing feature of speculative execution, and defeating all software-based attempts at fixing the vulnerabilities, according to Google researchers.
